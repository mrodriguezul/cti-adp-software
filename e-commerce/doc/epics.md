# LPA eComms - Epics

## List of Epics

The following Epics group the prioritized use cases into actionable development units. Each Epic contains the technical scope and the business justification.

### Epic-01: Identity & Access Management (IAM)
* **Description:** Build the security layer that manages user identities, handling registration, secure login, and role-based access control (RBAC) to separate Customers from Admins.
* **Priority:** High (P1)
* **Business Value:** Establishes trust and security. It protects customer personal data (GDPR/Privacy compliance) and ensures that only authorized staff can alter critical business data like inventory and financial records, preventing fraud and data corruption.
* **Key Scope:**
    * Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) generation and validation.
    * Create secure registration forms with input validation (Email format, Password strength).
    * Implement Password Hashing (Bcrypt) before storage in `lpa_users` and `lpa_clients`.
    * **Tech constraints:** Must differentiate between `lpa_clients` (Storefront) and `lpa_users` (Desktop Admin).

### Epic-02: Core Catalog & Inventory System
* **Description:** Develop the "Read" capability for customers to view products and the "Write" capability for Admins to manage inventory. This is the heart of the e-commerce system.
* **Priority:** High (P1)
* **Business Value:** The primary revenue driver. Customers cannot purchase what they cannot see. A well-structured catalog ensures accurate product presentation, while the Admin interface ensures operational efficiency, allowing staff to update prices and stock levels in real-time to avoid selling out-of-stock items.
* **Key Scope:**
    * **Frontend:** Create Product Listing Page (Grid view) and Product Detail Page (Specs, Price, Image).
    * **Backend:** API endpoints to fetch `lpa_stock` data (GET /products).
    * **Admin:** Interface to Add/Edit/Delete products and toggle Status (Active/Disabled).
    * **Data:** Display real-time `lpa_stock_onhand` availability.

### Epic-03: Shopping Cart & Session State
* **Description:** Implement the temporary storage mechanism that holds user intent (items to buy) before the transaction is finalized.
* **Priority:** High (P1)
* **Business Value:** Directly impacts Conversion Rate. A persistent and easy-to-use cart reduces "Cart Abandonment." By allowing users to easily modify quantities and see totals, we encourage larger basket sizes (Average Order Value).
* **Key Scope:**
    * Develop a persistent Cart (using LocalStorage or Session).
    * Functions to Add Item, Remove Item, and Update Quantity.
    * Validation: Prevent users from adding more quantity than is currently in stock (`lpa_stock_onhand`).
    * Calculate "Estimated Total" dynamically as items change.

### Epic-04: Checkout Engine & Order Processing
* **Description:** The transactional workflow. It converts a "Cart" into a permanent "Invoice" and updates the inventory.
* **Priority:** High (P1)
* **Business Value:** Revenue Realization. This is the moment value is captured. A smooth, error-free checkout flow is critical to prevent losing customers at the final step. It also ensures financial compliance by generating accurate, immutable invoice records.
* **Key Scope:**
    * **Multi-step Checkout:** Shipping Address entry -> Payment Selection -> Confirmation.
    * **Payment Simulation:** Integration with a mock provider (e.g., Stripe Test Mode) to return "Success" tokens.
    * **Order Generation:** Atomic transaction that:
        1.  Creates `lpa_invoices` record.
        2.  Creates `lpa_invoice_items` snapshots.
        3.  Decrements `lpa_stock_onhand`.
    * **Notification:** Display Order Success page with Invoice ID.

### Epic-05: Admin Order Fulfillment
* **Description:** The backend tools required for staff to process the orders generated by the Checkout Engine.
* **Priority:** High (P1)
* **Business Value:** Operational Excellence and Customer Satisfaction. Collecting money is only half the battle; the business must fulfill orders accurately and quickly. This tool gives warehouse staff the visibility needed to pick, pack, and ship items, reducing delivery errors.
* **Key Scope:**
    * **Dashboard:** List view of all Invoices with status indicators (Paid, Pending).
    * **Detail View:** View specific items, customer shipping address, and total amount for a selected invoice.
    * **Status Toggling:** Ability for Admin to change Invoice status (e.g., from "Paid" to "Shipped").

### Epic-06: Discovery & Search Optimization
* **Description:** Enhancements to help users find specific electronics within a potentially large catalog.
* **Priority:** Medium (P2)
* **Business Value:** Enhances User Experience (UX) and Sales Velocity. In electronics, customers often have specific needs (e.g., "Sony" or "Under $500"). If they can't filter or search, they leave. Effective search reduces the "Time to Purchase."
* **Key Scope:**
    * **Keyword Search:** Search bar querying `lpa_stock_name` and `lpa_stock_desc`.
    * **Filtering:** Sidebar filters for Price Range (Min/Max) and Category.
    * **Sorting:** Sort by Price (Low-High), Name (A-Z), and Newest.

### Epic-07: Customer Dashboard & Engagement
* **Description:** Features that allow customers to manage their own data and engage with the platform beyond just buying.
* **Priority:** Low (Mixed P2/P3)
* **Business Value:** Customer Retention and Reduced Support Costs. Allowing users to update their own addresses reduces calls to customer support. Wishlists and Reviews build "Stickiness" and Social Proof, encouraging repeat visits and building a community around the brand.
* **Key Scope:**
    * **Profile:** Edit Shipping Address and Phone Number (updates `lpa_clients`).
    * **Order History:** View list of past purchases and their status.
    * **Wishlist:** mechanism to save Product IDs to a user list without reserving stock.
    * **Reviews:** Ability to submit text/star ratings for purchased items.
