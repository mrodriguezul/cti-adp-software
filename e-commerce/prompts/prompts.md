E-commerce website LPA Ecomms

## USER PROMPT 1

You are an expert in product with experience in e-commerce.
I have the challenge of creating an e-commerce website for a case in a technical school, which is part of a software implementation for the case.
The trainer sent us a document with more details about the whole project; however, as far as I saw, it is very poor, and it's not completed (I attached the document, watch the e-commerce description).

I need you to define a list of basic functionalities that an e-commerce system has, and order them from highest to lowest priority.
Describe step by step how the customer journey works using an e-commerce.
What are the most important reasons to use an e-commerce?
Which alternatives to the e-commerce system exist, and when could they be relevant?
List me some e-commerce System examples (open source or private) with the most important characteristics.

Show me the information using charts or lists.

I am planning to create an e-commerce site for this case and also add some characteristics for future projects. Before starting the project, I need to know more details about e-commerce systems to create a new one that includes the basic functionalities and new features.

Do you understand?
Before you do that, ask me all the questions that you need to know to clarify the idea.
